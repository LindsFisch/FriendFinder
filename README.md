# FriendFinder

### Overview

Created a full-stack "compatibility-based" app that will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

The survey consists of 10 questions which has an answer on a scale of 1 to 5. The app compares current users' scores with that of those already in the database. The difference between the user's score and the database score is added up.   App pulls the user on the database with the least amount of difference as a 'match'.
